            "Recent military strategies exemplified by the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal and Ukraine conflict demonstrably shift from mass-casualty tactics toward precision operational disruption via drone-enabled maneuvers, integrated civilian-military coordination, and advanced psychological operations targeting enemy morale and infrastructure to achieve scalable strategic effects without large-scale fatalities.\n",
